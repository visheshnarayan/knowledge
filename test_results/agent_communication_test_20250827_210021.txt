Routed Topic: Literary Fiction
Agent Response: 

Based on the context provided, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are Harry Potter's aunt and uncle who live at number four, Privet Drive. They are described as striving to be perfectly normal and wanting nothing to do with anything strange or mysterious, which includes Harry's wizarding background from his parents' side of the family. The Dursleys live in a suburban muggle (non-magical) area and are keen to keep up appearances with their neighbors, being disturbed by any associations with the wizarding world.
