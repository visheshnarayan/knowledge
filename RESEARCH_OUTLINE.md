# Research Outline: Agentic Knowledge Graph Management

## 1. Introduction

Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, while effective at grounding large language models in factual data, often suffer from a static and context-unaware retrieval process. The retrieval mechanism is typically based on simple semantic similarity search over a flat vector space, which can fail to capture the complex relationships and thematic nuances within a corpus of documents. This limitation can lead to the retrieval of fragmented or peripherally related information, thereby constraining the generation model's ability to synthesize comprehensive and deeply reasoned answers. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework for Agentic Knowledge Graph Management, moving beyond simple retrieval to a more dynamic and intelligent system of knowledge organization and traversal.

Our proposed system implements a multi-agent architecture to dynamically construct, partition, and interact with a knowledge graph built from unstructured text. Instead of treating knowledge as a static repository, our approach views it as a dynamic structure managed by specialized intelligent agents. A high-level "Parent Agent" orchestrates the initial analysis of the document corpus, identifying emergent thematic clusters and partitioning the graph accordingly. Specialized "Child Agents" are then assigned to each thematic subgraph, becoming experts in their respective domains. This hierarchical structure enables a more sophisticated query resolution process, where queries are routed to the appropriate specialist agent, which then intelligently traverses its local graph to build context and generate nuanced responses.

## 2. Methodology

The methodology for this research is realized through a multi-stage computational pipeline. The first stage involves the automated construction of a knowledge graph from a corpus of unstructured text documents. This process begins with text segmentation into manageable chunks, followed by the generation of vector embeddings using a transformer model (bert-base-uncased). Two distinct but complementary graphs are then constructed: a semantic similarity graph based on the cosine similarity of chunk embeddings, and a knowledge triplet graph extracted using a specialized model (Babelscape/rebel-large). These dual representations capture both implicit semantic relationships and explicit factual statements, forming a rich substrate for the subsequent agent-based analysis.

Following graph construction, a hierarchical topic modeling and partitioning process is initiated, orchestrated by a "Parent Agent" powered by a sophisticated large language model (e.g., DeepSeek). This agent systematically analyzes the entire graph to identify overarching themes, assigning each text chunk to a primary topic. A key innovation in this stage is the iterative topic consolidation process, where the Parent Agent refines the initial topic clusters by merging semantically similar topics until a stable and coherent thematic structure is achieved. The result is a partitioned graph, where each partition represents a distinct domain of knowledge, managed and understood by the Parent Agent.

Finally, the system is operationalized through an agentic framework built on Strands AI. For each identified topic, a specialized "Child Agent" (e.g., using Claude 3.5 Sonnet) is instantiated and assigned ownership of the corresponding subgraph. When a user poses a query, the Parent Agent first acts as a router, analyzing the query to determine the most relevant topic and forwarding the request to the appropriate Child Agent. This specialist agent then performs a dynamic context-building search, traversing its local subgraph to find the most relevant information. This traversal is not a simple similarity search but a guided exploration, allowing the agent to synthesize information from multiple nodes to generate a comprehensive and contextually aware response.

## 3. Conclusion

This research successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of a prototype for an Agentic Knowledge Graph Management system. By moving beyond the limitations of traditional RAG, our framework introduces a dynamic, multi-agent approach to knowledge organization and retrieval. The implemented pipeline—encompassing dual-graph construction, LLM-driven topic consolidation, and a hierarchical parent-child agent architecture—provides a robust foundation for more intelligent and context-aware information systems. The successful routing of queries to specialized agents, which then build context through graph traversal, validates the core hypothesis that agent-driven management can lead to more nuanced and accurate information synthesis.

The current implementation, while functional, represents an initial step. The "Future Work" section of the project documentation outlines several key avenues for advancement. These include the development of protocols for live document ingestion and inter-agent collaboration, which would allow the system to learn and adapt continuously. Integrating a dedicated vector database like Pinecone would significantly enhance scalability and search efficiency. Further research should also focus on fine-tuning the specialist agents on their respective subgraphs to deepen their domain expertise and exploring methods to visualize the agent's iterative search process, providing greater transparency into the system's reasoning. Ultimately, this agentic approach holds significant promise for the future of knowledge management, paving the way for systems that can autonomously organize, reason about, and interact with complex information landscapes.
