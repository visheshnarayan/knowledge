Question: Who are Mr. and Mrs. Dursley and where do they live?
Routed Topic: Literary Fiction
Agent Response: 

Based on the context provided, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are Harry Potter's aunt and uncle. They live on Privet Drive, specifically at number four. Some key details:

- Mr. Dursley is described as a "big, beefy man with hardly any neck" who works as the director of a drill company called Grunnings. 

- Mrs. Dursley is thin and blonde, and likes spying on her neighbors.

- They have a son named Dudley who they dote on.

- They live in fear that their neighbors will find out about their relation to the Potters, who are wizards.

- Harry Potter is dropped off at their doorstep at number four, Privet Drive after the death of his parents.

So in summary, the Dursleys are Harry's non-magical aunt and uncle who live on Privet Drive, and take in Harry as a baby after his parents are killed.
